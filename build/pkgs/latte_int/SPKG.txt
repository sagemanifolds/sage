=== latte-int-1.7.1 (Dima Pasechnik, Oct 9, 2014) ===
 * bump up to 1.7.1, fix spkg-install (cf #17136),
 * switch to the new spkg layout

=== latte-int-1.6 (Dima Pasechnik, Sept 9, 2013) ===
 * Initial version

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * the upstream tarball is extracted from the tarball of tarballs bundle latte-integrale at
   https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/software/packages/latte_current/
 * the name should be changed from latte-int-* to latte_int-* to reflect the Sage package
   naming; not only for the tarball itself, but also for its contents; i.e. you should
   untar latte-int-*.tar.gz somewhere, move latte-int-*/ to latte_int-*/, and make the tarball
   again.
