== Patches ==
 * NTL6_compatibility.patch  taken from commit
   ddb348e97a991972e5dfee690a66663ba0418f40
   and further updated.
 * factory_template_instantiation.patch taken from commit
   561842a06ad4b44f3b85b28ac35e7946eaba9a30
 * assert.patch: logic seems to be broken on some platforms
 * configure_comma.patch: remove a superfluous "," from configure.
 * Minor.h.patch: needs to have <time.h> included on Cygwin
 * slibdir.patch: set default slibdir to ${datarootdir}/singular
   instead of ${prefix}/LIB, see #13344.
 * sage_trac_14295.patch: Fix for GCC 4.7.x on Solaris; see
   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14295 and the changelog
   entry for singular-3-1-5.p5 below.
 * osx_link.patch: #14415: Fixes linker problems on OS X PPC.
 * sanitize_gmp_header_hack.patch:
   Fix and simplify generation of `factory/cf_gmp.h` (cf. #14737).
 * flint.patch: avoid underlinking FLINT in libsingular.
 * exeext.patch: Add $(EXEEXT) to some executable names.
 * cygwin64.path: Support for Cywgin64.
 * singular-3.1.6-fix_mpoly_factor_segfault.patch:
   Fix potential segfault in factorization of multivariate poly-
   nomials.  Collection / subset of upstream commits, latest
   being 28f4fe9464722511718050dfab7cd61d29898968.
   (Cf. #16462 and Singular trac #621.)
 * singular-3.1.6-no_return_type.patch:
   State return type of main functions so that Singular builds
   with clang.
 * no_usr_local.patch: Do not add /usr/local/{lib,include} "just in
   case" to the LDFLAGS/CPPFLAGS. Especially not at the end ...

The following patches fix errors that only occur in a debug build, see
http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16938
They shouldn't be needed any more in the next Singular version:

 * hans-polyvectorerror.patch: Fix erroneous "mixed poly/vector" error
   message
 * hans-slimgb-and-letterplace.patch: Fix incorrect debug assertions
   in slimgb and letterplace algebras
 * hans-integerpolys.patch: Fix incorrect assertions in integer
   polynomials.


Other notes
 * The option '--without-dynamic-kernel' is used on *all*
   systems with the exception of Linux. The online README at
   http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/svn/trunk/README says this should
   be used on Solaris, with no mention of it being necessary for
   OS X, or any other platform except Solaris.
 * The online readme says that CONFIG_SHELL should be set to /bin/bash
   on Solaris. This is not done currently. Since this does not build
   fully as a 64-bit application on Solaris, CONFIG_SHELL should be
   investigated as a possible cause later.
 * Be sure that Singular/Singular.rc.in is present, as occasionally this
   was missing, which caused problems on Cygwin (e.g., see #10235)
 * Due to http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/438, we
   currently always build Singular with its debug code.  Change
   --with-debug to $WITH_DEBUG in the configure call if this is fixed.
 * If the environment variable SAGE_DEBUG is set to "yes", then
   omalloc will be replaced by xalloc. The resulting Singular executable
   and libsingular library will be slower than with omalloc, but allow
   for easier debugging of memory corruptions.
